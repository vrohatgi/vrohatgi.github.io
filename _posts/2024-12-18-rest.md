I have been building REST APIs for the entirety of my 3-year-long career, and I thought it would be a good idea to write my learnings
about good API design.

# What is an API?
API stands for Application Programming Interface. An API is a set of rules that allows different software components (e.g. computers, programs, routines, etc.)
to interact with each other. It defines how requests and responses should be structured, enabling one component to request specific operations or data from another.

# REpresentational State Transfer
In 2000, Roy Fielding, one of the key contributors to HTTP, codified the REST architectural style. REST is used for creating 
web services that use HTTP to communicate. 

## Hypertext Transfer Protocol
HTTP is the most commonly used application-layer protocol for the web. It is used for transmitting hypermedia documents, such
as HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). What is a hypermedia document? It's simply a digital document that contains 
links to other documents or media.

HTTP is **stateless**, meaning each request is independent and must contain all the information needed to complete it. An HTTP
request includes the request (the method, request-URI, and HTTP version), headers, and optionally, a body (data sent with the request). 

The following are the methods supported by HTTP:

1. **GET**: Used to **retrieve data** from a server at a specified resource. GET requests should be **idempotent** and **safe**, meaning 
they do not modify data on the server and can be repeated without any side effects.
2. **POST**: Used to **send data** to a server to create a new resource. This method can change the server's state and is **not 
idempotent**, meaning multiple identical requests will result in multiple resources being created.
3. **PUT**: Used to **update a resource** with the data provided, or create the resource if it does not exist. PUT is **idempotent**, 
meaning if you send the same request multiple times, the result will be the same as if you sent it once.
4. **DELETE**: Used to **remove the specified resource** from the server. Like PUT, DELETE is also **idempotent**.
5. **HEAD**: Similar to GET, but it only **retrieves the headers of the response**, without the response body. Useful for checking 
if a resource exists or for retrieving metadata.
6. **OPTIONS**: Used to **describe the communication options** for the target resource. It can be used to determine the methods 
supported by a web server or resource.
7. **PATCH**: Used to **apply partial modifications** to a resource. Unlike PUT, which requires the full updated resource, PATCH 
only requires the changes.
8. **TRACE**: Used to **perform a message loop-back test** along the path to the target resource, mainly for diagnostic purposes.
9. **CONNECT**: Used to **establish a tunnel** to the server identified by the target resource. It's primarily used for SSL 
tunneling through an HTTP proxy.

HTTP headers are key-value pairs included in HTTP requests and responses. They convey additional information about the 
request or response, or about the object sent in the message body. Headers play a crucial role in defining the operating 
parameters of an HTTP transaction, such as content type, caching policies, client and server capabilities, and more.

Commonly used HTTP headers include:
1. **Authorization**: Contains credentials for authenticating a user agent with a server.
2. **Connection**: Controls whether the network connection stays open after the current transaction.
3. **Host**: Specifies the domain name of the server and (optionally) the TCP port number on which the server is listening.
4. **Referer**: The address of the previous web page from which a link to the currently requested page was followed.

This is an example HTTP GET request:
```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/85.0.4183.121 Safari/537.36
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Connection: keep-alive
```

The HTTP response includes the response code, response headers, and the response body. The format of the body is indicated by the `Content-Type` 
header in the response, which specifies a **MIME type** (Media Type). This can be JSON data, an HTML document, a JPEG image, etc. 
HTTP response codes, also known as status codes, are three-digit numbers that indicate the outcome of the HTTP request. They are grouped into five categories:

1. **1xx: Informational**
These codes indicate that the request was received and understood, and the client should continue with the request. An 
example is `100 Continue` - the server has received the request headers, and the client should proceed to send the 
request body. 
2. **2xx: Success**
These codes indicate that the request was successfully received, understood, and accepted. An example is `200 OK` - the 
request was successful, and the server is returning the requested data. Another example is `201 Created` - the request 
was successful, and a new resource was created as a result.
3. **3xx: Redirection**
These codes indicate that further action is needed to complete the request, often involving redirection.
An example is `301 Moved Permanently` - the requested resource has been permanently moved to a new URL provided in the response. 
Another example is `302 Found` - the requested resource temporarily resides under a different URL. 
4. **4xx: Client Error**
These codes indicate that there was an error with the request, and the client appears to be at fault.
An example is `400 Bad Request` - the server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax. Another example is 
`401 Unauthorized` - the request requires user authentication. Another common one is `404 Not Found` - the server cannot 
find the requested resource. 
5. **5xx: Server Error**
These codes indicate that the server failed to fulfill a valid request. An example is `500 Internal Server Error` - the 
server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request. Another example is `503 Service 
Unavailable` - the server is currently unable to handle the request due to temporary overload or maintenance.

## Okay, so why did I spend so much time explaining HTTP?
The REST constraints don't specify a specific protocol, but HTTP is almost always used. What exactly are the REST constraints?

1. **Uniform Interface**: There’s a standard way for the client and server to communicate, making it easier to understand and use the service.
2. **Stateless**: Each request from the client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and process it. 
The server doesn’t remember anything about the client between requests.
3. **Cacheable**: Some responses can be stored and reused to speed things up and reduce the number of times the server needs 
to be asked for the same information.
4. **Client-Server**: The client and the server are kept separate so they can work independently and be updated without affecting each other.
5. **Layered System**: A client cannot tell whether it is connected directly to the end server, or to an intermediary along the way.
6. **Code on Demand (Optional)**: The server can send code (like scripts) to the client to run, which can add new features 
or capabilities on the fly. This is optional and not always used.

# Creating a Well-Designed Application Programming Interface

## 1. Define Clear API Objectives and Use Cases
Before diving into the technicalities, it's crucial to define what your API will do. Clear objectives and use cases will 
guide your design decisions and help you focus on what's essential for your users.

## 2. Design the API Endpoints
REST is resource-based. Identify the primary resources in your application. For example, if you are designing a blog API, 
resources might include posts, comments, and users.

Keep **URIs** simple and intuitive. Use nouns to represent resources, and follow a consistent, hierarchical structure. For example:

    - `GET /api/posts` - Retrieve all posts

    - `GET /api/posts/{id}` - Retrieve a specific post

    - `POST /api/posts` - Create a new post

    - `PUT /api/posts/{id}` - Update a specific post

    - `DELETE /api/posts/{id}` - Delete a specific post

Include **versioning** in your API design to manage changes over time without breaking existing clients. A 
common approach is to include the version number in the URL path, such as `/api/v1/posts`. You can also use headers for 
versioning, but the URL path is more explicit and easier to manage.

The API spec should include the endpoint, the HTTP method, the request shape, the response shape, authorization rules, and 
a description of the purpose of the endpoint.

## 3. HTTP Methods and Status Codes
Use the appropriate HTTP methods (verbs) to perform operations on your resources. Use standard HTTP status codes to convey 
the outcome of an API request. See above.

## 4. Handle Data Formats and Content Negotiation
JSON is the most commonly used data format for REST APIs due to its readability and ease of use. However, your API should 
be capable of handling other formats like XML if required by your clients. Use the `Accept` and `Content-Type` headers 
to specify and respond with the appropriate data format. For example, a client can request JSON with `Accept: application/json`,
and the API should respond accordingly.

## 5. Authentication and Authorization
Implement secure authentication mechanisms such as OAuth 2.0, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), or API keys. Avoid sending credentials
in URLs; use headers instead. Ensure that users can only access resources they are permitted to. Use roles and permissions 
to manage access control.

## 6. Error Handling and Response Structure
Provide clear and consistent error messages with a standard structure. Include error codes, messages, and any additional 
details that can help the client understand and resolve the issue. For example:
```
{
  "error": {
    "code": 400,
    "message": "Invalid request data",
    "details": "The 'email' field is required."
  }
}
```
Implement logging for all API requests and errors. This will help in debugging and monitoring the performance of your API.

## 7. Rate Limiting and Throttling
Protect your API from abuse by implementing **rate limiting**. Define limits on the number of requests a client can make in a given time period.
Inform clients when they are approaching or exceeding their limits by returning appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., `429 Too Many Requests`) 
and include headers to indicate the limit status and reset time.

## 8. Pagination, Filtering, and Sorting
For endpoints that return lists of resources, implement **pagination** to manage large data sets effectively. Use query parameters like 
`?page=1&limit=20` to allow clients to specify the page and the number of items per page.
Allow clients to **filter** results based on specific criteria. Use query parameters such as `?status=active&category=tech`. 
Provide options for **sorting** results. 

## 9. Documentation and Testing
Provide comprehensive and up-to-date documentation for your API. Tools like Swagger/OpenAPI can help generate interactive 
API docs that are easy for developers to understand and use. Implement thorough testing for your API, including unit tests,
integration tests, and end-to-end tests. Use tools like Postman or automated frameworks to ensure your API behaves as expected.

## 10. Caching
Use HTTP headers like `ETag`, `Cache-Control`, and `Last-Modified` to implement caching strategies that reduce server 
load and improve response times. Encourage clients to cache responses where applicable, using the appropriate HTTP headers 
to control cache behavior.

## 11. Security Best Practices
Always use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit and protect against man-in-the-middle attacks. Validate and sanitize all 
input data to prevent injection attacks, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS). Only expose the endpoints 
and data necessary for the API's intended functionality. Use whitelists and firewalls to restrict access.
